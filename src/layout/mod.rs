//! This module is where we convert ParseNodes to Layout boxes which are ready to be rendered.
//! The layout boxes follow a similar model as those found in HTML and TeX in that they both
//! have horizontal and vertical boxes.  One difference will be how glue is handled.  HTML/CSS
//! does not have anything similar to how glue is handled in TeX and so aboslute size will be 
//! necessary for these scnarios.  It's unclear if we will be able to induce alignments from
//! glue, such as something being centered, aligned left/right, etc.  These questions may
//! also be useful to answer in SVG.
//!
//! Layout boxes will contain a minimal representation of what will be rendered.
//! This includes the container types: Horizontal/Vertical boxes,
//! and primitive types: Symbols, lines, spacing.
//!
//! While rendering in mathmode, most types require an atomtype to determine the kerning
//! between symbols.  This information must also be present with layout boxes.
//!
//! The units used in layout boxes must be in pixels (as defined in CSS).
